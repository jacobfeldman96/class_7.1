## Final Review of PyViz & Dashboards and Intro to SQL

Today's class began with a review of dashboards. We discussed how dashboards are very useful for displaying KPIs or Key Performance Indicators in a clear, concise and streamlined manner. A dashboard is both customizable and dynamic. PyViz is an open source, free program available on Python. The three plotting interfaces available that make up PyViz are HvPlot, matplotlib and plotly express. These three plots can be created in Python and pushed to a panel that can be used as part of an online dashboard. 

We then discussed the difference between panels and panes. A pane is a snapshot of the graph whereas a panel is a functionality that can be pushed online. 

There are three different setups for panels, where the graphed data can be organized into rows, columns or tabs. All of these panels can be pushed from Python to a web app via the CLI.

Panel extensions are additional visualization technologies that can be used to create engaging dashboards.

### SQL

SQL stands for Standard Query Language and is one of the most popular coding languages. Its use is for storing, manipulating, populating and updating databases in a similar way to Python. Postgres functions as an object relational database management system where data is created in tables, in a similar way to Excell. pdAdmin is like the Jupyter Labs of SQL, where the GUI makes for an easier experience. 

SQL, unlike Python, is a persistant langauge, where commands are not overriden sequentially throughout the code. Therefore, one must highlight the line of code which one wishes to run in order to avoid errors. Schemas = all tables in a database. * will highlight everything in a table. CRUD stands for: Create, Read, Update and Delete. The commands are INSERT INTO, SELECT * FROM from Create and Read respectively. The video recording finished with two activities allowing us to practice creating and populating DBs. 

I was having difficulty refreshing and seeing the tables created even after refreshing. I will check in with a TA during office hours.
